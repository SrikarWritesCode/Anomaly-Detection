# Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD)

ASD is the task of identifying whether the sound emitted from a machine is normal or anomalous. It is important for the following reasons:
- It can help identify potential issues with machines before they lead to costly downtime or failure.
- In industries such as manufacturing, where machines are a critical part of the production process, early detection of anomalies can help prevent disruptions to the production line and reduce the overall cost of maintaining the machines.
- Many machines produce sounds that can indicate their condition and performance. By using machine learning algorithms to automatically detect anomalous sounds, it is possible to monitor the health and performance of machines in real-time.

## Training an effective machine learning algorithm

In order to train an effective machine learning algorithm for anomalous sound detection, it is important to have a large and diverse dataset of normal and anomalous sounds. This will allow the algorithm to learn the patterns of normal sounds and accurately identify anomalies.

## Methodology and Concepts

Machine learning algorithms for anomalous sound detection often rely on features extracted from the sound signal to train and make predictions. One common method for extracting features from audio is called Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). Autoencoders are one type of machine learning model that can be used for anomalous sound detection, which can learn to compress and reconstruct input data, such as MFCCs.

## Data

The data used in this task is a combination of parts of the ToyADMOS and MIMII datasets, which contain normal and anomalous operating sounds of six different types of toy and real machines. The anomalous sounds in these datasets were collected by intentionally damaging the target machines. The six types of machines included in the task are: Toy-car and Toy-conveyor from ToyADMOS, and valves, pumps, fans, and slide rails from the MIMII dataset. All recordings are single-channel and were captured using a fixed microphone. Each recording is approximately 10 seconds long and includes both the machine's operating sounds and ambient noise. The sampling rate for all signals has been reduced to 16 kHz.

## Real-Time Monitoring

By using machine learning algorithms to automatically detect anomalous sounds, it is possible to monitor the health and performance of machines in real-time. In order to train an effective machine learning algorithm for anomalous sound detection, it is important to have a large and diverse dataset of normal and anomalous sounds. This will allow the algorithm to learn the patterns of normal sounds and accurately identify anomalies.
