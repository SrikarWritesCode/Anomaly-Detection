# Anomaly-Detection
ASD is the task of identifying whether the sound emitted from a machine is normal or anomalous. It is important for the following reasons:

It can help identify potential issues with machines before they lead to costly downtime or failure.
In industries such as manufacturing, where machines are a critical part of the production process, early detection of anomalies can help prevent disruptions to the production line and reduce the overall cost of maintaining the machines.
Many machines produce sounds that can indicate their condition and performance. By using machine learning algorithms to automatically detect anomalous sounds, it is possible to monitor the health and performance of machines in real-time.
Training an effective machine learning algorithm
In order to train an effective machine learning algorithm for anomalous sound detection, it is important to have a large and diverse dataset of normal and anomalous sounds. This will allow the algorithm to learn the patterns of normal sounds and accurately identify anomalies.
